# Voroffset

Discrete mesh offsetting based on half-space Voronoi diagrams and Power diagrams.

### Compilation

All dependencies are included in the `3rdparty/` folder. To compile the code, just type:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -j8
```

### Running the code

See possible options with:

```bash
./offset3d -h
```

Example usage:

```
./offset3d ../data/models/basic/filigree.ply -n 512 -p 10 -r 5 -x dilation
```

##### offset2d

Takes a .svg file as input, and saves the result of the dilation as a quad-mesh (.obj).

##### offset3d

Takes a triangle mesh as input (.stl, .obj, .off), and saves the dilated output as a mesh (quad-mesh with .obj, hex-mesh with .mesh, etc.)

```

  -u,--radius_in_mm           Radius is given in mm instead
```

### Figures

The two plots in the paper can be reproduced by running the corresponding scripts in the `python/` folder.
Simply uncomment the lines doing the batch processing, or simply regenerate the plots from the provided .json databases.
